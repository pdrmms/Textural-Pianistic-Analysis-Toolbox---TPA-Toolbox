# Textural-Pianistic-Analysis-Toolbox---TPA-Toolbox

The Textural Pianistic Analysis Toolbox is a set of Matlab data, scripts, and functions devised to operate and visualize pianistic textural structures. It is linked to research in progress developed at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
A _manual pianistic partition_,_PMP_for short, is a textural configuration observed from its arrangement in the pianist's hands.
